        <ul>
            <li>1 pound of dried spagetti</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of good quality olive oil</li>
            <li>6-8 cloves of garlic - very thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper</li>
            <li>Optional garnishes: chopped fresh parsley, freshly-grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <strong>Cook the spaghetti.</strong> Bring a large stockpot of <strong>COLD</strong> generously-salted water to a boil.  Add spaghetti and cook until nearly al dente (like, just one minute shy of being done).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong><strong> Sauté the garlic.</strong>Meanwhile, about 3 minutes after you add the pasta to the boiling water, heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat.  Add the sliced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes and sauté for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it is lightly golden.  (It’s very important that the garlic not burn.  So if the pasta is not ready to go by the time the garlic is lightly golden, remove the sauté pan from the heat until the pasta is ready.)
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Toss the pasta in the sauce. </strong>As soon as the pasta is ready to go, use tongs to transfer the pasta to the sauté pan, along with 1/2 cup of the hot starchy pasta water.  Toss the pasta continuously until it is evenly coated in the garlic sauce.  If the sauce looks a bit too dry, add in another 1/4 cup of the starchy pasta water.

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Taste and season.</strong>Give the pasta a quick taste add an extra pinch of salt and/or crushed red pepper flakes if needed.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> <strong>Serve.</strong>Serve immediately while it’s nice and hot, garnished with any toppings that sound good.
</p>
<p><strong>A few important tips from professionals:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Have all of your ingredients ready to go.</strong> Things move fairly quickly once the pasta begins to cook, so I recommend having all of your ingredients laid out, chopped and ready to go.</li>
    <li><strong>It’s important that the garlic not burn.</strong> If turns lightly golden before the pasta is ready to go, just remove the pan from the heat until it’s time to add the pasta.</li>
    <li><strong>*Don’t forget to salt that pasta water!</strong> Adding salt to the water is strictly for flavor. You want to salt the water as it is coming to a boil. While the pasta is cooking, it absorbs the salt adding just that extra touch to the overall meal. Do as Mario Batali does and salt the water until it “tastes like the sea.” To get that saltiness, Mark Ladner, executive chef at Del Posto, advises to use about 1 tbsp. of salt per quart of water.</li>
    <li><strong>*Always use cold water!</strong> This goes for cooking anything with water. Hot water dissolves pollutants more quickly than cold, and some pipes contain lead that can leak into the water. Just to be safe, always use cold water from the tap and run the water for a little before using.</li>
    <li><strong> *Do not put oil in the pot.</strong> Olive oil is said to prevent the pot from boiling over and prevent the pasta from sticking together. But, the general consensus is that it does more harm than good. It can prevent the sauce from sticking to the pasta. Since oil is less dense than water and is composed of hydrophobic molecules, it creates a layer across the top of the water. When the pasta is drained, it is poured through this oiled layer and leaves a fresh coat of oil on the pasta.

However, if you are not using a sauce or are using an olive oil base, then the oil has little effect.</li>

<p><strong>A few important tips from professionals:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong> Kokoda is considered to be the national dish
of Fiji, found in the continent of Oceania. It is
similar to the more familiar ceviche in that it
is cooked in vinegar and without heat. Once
the acidity of the vinegar cooks the fish, it is
served in coconut milk with freshly chopped
vegetables (and often in a coconut shell) for a
refreshing and delicious meal.  </strong> </li>
    <li><strong> This dish can be made with many different
types of white fish. Ask your fishmonger what
firm, white fish is most fresh for this recipe.
Examples of fine alternatives to snapper may
include bass, sole, or grouper</strong> </li>
    <li><strong> Kokoda is traditionally cooked in juice from nearly a cup of citrus juice. To save time without losing flavor, this recipe uses white
vinegar to cook the fish. </strong> </li>
    <li><strong> If not eaten by itself, this dish may traditionally be served with taro chips, but it could also be served with brown rice, roasted sweet potato wedges, tortilla chips, or taco shells.</strong> </li>
    </ul>

<p><strong>A few important tips from professionals:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong> This gets better and better over time so making it a day in advance is a great idea!</strong> </li>
    <li><strong> It's customizable to your own taste! Feel free to swap out ingredients with something similar to it. Ex: If you don't like zucchini you can swap it out with cucumber instead. </strong> </li>
