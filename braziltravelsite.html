        <h1>Travel to Brazil</h1>
        <img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/05/Flag_of_Brazil.svg/188px-Flag_of_Brazil.svg.png"><img src = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/Coat_of_arms_of_Brazil.svg/128px-Coat_of_arms_of_Brazil.svg.png">

<h2>Food</h2>
<p>
    Many Brazilian recipes are passed down throughout generations. There are a few dishes older than those who are eating it! 
<br><br>
Feijoada for instance stems from the word feijão which translates to bean. As you can guess it's a black bean based dish that has meat and vegetable and it's been declared as Brazil's national dish. This dish is mostly seen at large Brazilian family gatherings and can take a few days to make. A culinary historian named Jessie B. Harris compared the feijoada to American soul food and she is correct in doing so! When I was young that was the meal we had when we were short on money because it was cheaper to make and could feed you many for several days. When I am feeling sad I still go to an American restraunt called Texas de Brasil because their black beans is actually feijoada and it's very comforting to go along with BBQ from my home country.<br>

</p>
<p>
Most meals will come with black beans and rice and salad or fried collard greens. Farofa which is a type of meal made from toasted cassava is often paired with many different dishes and would be seen at a buffet. It pairs very well with meat dishes because it has a slightly smokey and salty taste to it. Often I would put it on my black beans and rice and mix it in and it's absolutely delicious so it makes sense to always be served with feijoada.<br>

<h3>Must see places</h3>
<p>
I will never recommend the usual tourist places due to it actually being dangerous in those areas due to them being tourist destinations they tend to have a lot of crime. Instead I wish to focus on places that are absolutely incredible and where you can truly dig into the culture of Brazil without needing to see the famouse statue Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer in English) in Rio de Janeiro. Yes it is pretty neat how big it is but it isn't worth the risk of being in the middle of the crime aimed at tourists.<br>

<strong><em>Bauru</em></strong>
<img src ="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Bauru_2013.jpg"><br>
If you come to Bauru you must try their famous sandwhich! The Bauru sandwhich:<br> <img src ="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/Sandu%C3%ADche_Bauru.jpg/360px-Sandu%C3%ADche_Bauru.jpg"><br>
French bun with crumb removed, cheese (usually mozzarella), roast beef, tomatoes and pickled cucumbers. Basic but delicious for a quick lunch! There are many variations of this Bauru sandwhich however this is the traditional and authentic way to make it.<br><br></p>
<strong>Parque Zoológico Municipal de Bauru</strong><br><p>
This zoo is open every day of the week! Monday through Friday from 8am- 4pm while open even longer on Saturday and Sunday from 8am-5pm. However their House of Reptiles does close from 11:30am-1:30pm everyday. The tickets are very affordable for the entire family! 5.00 BRL for children 5 years old and adults which equates to $1 USD and seniors are only BRL 2.50! Children under 5 get to go in for free as well. Since opening in 1980 their main objective has always been conservationism and because it is located in an area of preserved vegetation, the zoo is home to several species of regional native fauna, such as the toucan-toco, coati, jacupemba, calango-verde, teiú, among others that live freely in the place.<br>

<em>(These next few are not well known enough to have a wiklipedia page so no pictures are available to add. Google the places and you will find just how gorgeous they are!)</em>
<br><br>
<strong>Pinacoteca Municipal de Bauru - Casa Ponce Paz</strong><br>

Not a well known art gallery except to locals. This historic secret home located in the center of Bauru has incredibly charming artwork that was found during the restoration process. They always have an interesting and impactful exhibition and the renovations seemed to have already been completed. Sometimes it is possible to find artists painting in the backyard while you are touring which I find absolutely charming and adds to the experience. This tour as of 2021 was free to walk in and is a guided tour. <br><br>
<strong>Bauru Municipal Botanical Garden</strong><br>

Great place to bring the kids and yourselves to relax and provide a space for the children to explore. There is so much out there in nature for children to be curious over and this one is a must see! Absolutely gorgeous gardens that are actually located right next to the zoo! (Parque Zoológico Municipal de Bauru mentioned previously in the article.) "Municipal Botanical Garden of Bauru was created in 1994 on the land of the former Municipal Ecological Park of Bauru. With 321 hectares, it is one of the largest and most important native conservation reserves in the Cerrado Paulista. It has a varied living collection of plants, organized into collections, with an unrivaled selection of specimens of regional and national flora. It is open to the public, being a botanical center for the study and conservation of flora, as well as a place of education and culture."</p><br><br>
